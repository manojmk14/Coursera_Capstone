    "Have taken few major Indian cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Pune & Bangaluru to do the above analysis. Suppose if you have to visit one of the cities then which city would you go to where you get pizza easily and one don’t need to travel far for the pizza. Solving the first scenario we get to solve one more problem that’s if say suppose one wants to invest or start a pizza outlet then one should invest in which cities from the above selected cities?"

The problem we aim to solve is to analyze the Pizza stores’ locations in these Indian cities and find the best place for our tourist so that he can have a good time enjoying the piza. Our main target are tourists with a taste of western-style pizza.\n",

    "The main target here is to asses which city would have the highest Pizza store density. I used the Four Square API through the venue channel. I used the near query to get venues in the cities. Also, I use the CategoryID to set it to show only Pizza Places. \n",
    "API Request format for Venue : .e.g.https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id=&client_secret=&v=20180605&Mumbaik,Delhi&limit=100&categoryId=4bf58dd8d48988d1ca941735\n",
    "Also, Foursquare limits us to maximum of 100 venues per query.\n",
    "Moreover, I repeated this request for the 5 studied cities and got their top 100 venues. I saved the name and coordinate data only from the result and plotted them on the map for visual inspection.Next, to get an indicator of the density of Pizza Places, I calculated a center coordinate of the venues to get the mean longitude and latitude values. Then calculated the mean of the Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates. That was my indicator; mean distance to the mean coordinate. Using these methodology, we will be soloving the above two solution."
