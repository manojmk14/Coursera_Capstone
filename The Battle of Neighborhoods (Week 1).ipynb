Splving the first scenario one get to solve one more problem thats if say suppose one wants to invest or start a piza outleat then one shoud invest in which cities from the above."

    "The main target here is to asses which city would have the highest Pizza store density. I used the Four Square API through the venue channel. I used the near query to get venues in the cities. Also, I use the CategoryID to set it to show only Pizza Places. \n",
    "API Request format for Venue : .e.g.https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/explore?&client_id=&client_secret=&v=20180605&Mumbaik,Delhi&limit=100&categoryId=4bf58dd8d48988d1ca941735\n",
    "Also, Foursquare limits us to maximum of 100 venues per query.\n",
    "Moreover, I repeated this request for the 5 studied cities and got their top 100 venues. I saved the name and coordinate data only from the result and plotted them on the map for visual inspection.Next, to get an indicator of the density of Pizza Places, I calculated a center coordinate of the venues to get the mean longitude and latitude values. Then calculated the mean of the Euclidean distance from each venue to the mean coordinates. That was my indicator; mean distance to the mean coordinate. Using these methodology, we will be soloving the above two solution."
